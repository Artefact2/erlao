Compiling
=========

To compile the Erlang source files, just run the `make` command. You
can test it by running the "playraw" demo script.

To generate the EDoc documentation (which is just an Erlang-friendly
version of the official libao documentation), run `make docs` and
browse the HTML files in the "docs" directory.
